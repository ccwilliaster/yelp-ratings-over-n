            I was interested in the number of Yelp reviews necessary before an average rating
            accurately reflects the <span class="emph">stabilized </span> average rating. Using Yelp's
            <a href="https://www.yelp.com/academic_dataset">academic dataset</a> I filtered for businesses
            which had <span class="emph">&gt;500 reviews</span> and looked at 
            cumulative averages as review counts increased over time. 
            <br/><br/>
            Each line in the meta plot represents a single business and illustrates how its rating has
            changed as a function of reviews, compared to the eventual <span class="emph">stabilized</span> rating.
            Hover over a line for summary information and a link to that business's histogram. The slider below 
            the plot controls the upper limit for number of reviews.
            <br/><br/>
            In general, the ratings stabilize with more reviews but it's rare that an average review is ever
            more than one star away from the eventual <span class="emph">stabilized</span> rating. The 
            data also show that initial reviews are slightly skewed toward higher ratings compared to the 
            <span class="emph">stabilized</span> rating.
